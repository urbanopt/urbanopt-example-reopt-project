   ************* Beginning Plant Sizing Calculations
   ** Warning ** Check input. Pump nominal power or motor efficiency is set to 0, for pump=BOOSTER WATER LOOP PUMP
   ** Warning ** Missing temperature setpoint for LeavingSetpointModulated mode Boiler named BOILER
   **   ~~~   **   A temperature setpoint is needed at the outlet node of a boiler in variable flow mode
   **   ~~~   **   use a Setpoint Manager to establish a setpoint at the boiler outlet node 
   **   ~~~   **   or use an EMS actuator to establish a setpoint at the boiler outlet node 
   **   ~~~   **   The overall loop setpoint will be assumed for Boiler. The simulation continues ...

   ************* ===== Final Error Summary =====
   ************* The following error categories occurred.  Consider correcting or noting.
   ************* Nominally Unused Constructions
   ************* ..The nominally unused constructions warning is provided to alert you to potential conditions that can cause
   ************* ..extra time during simulation. Each construction is calculated by the algorithm indicated in the HeatBalanceAlgorithm
   ************* ..object. You may remove the constructions indicated (when you use the DisplayExtraWarnings option).
